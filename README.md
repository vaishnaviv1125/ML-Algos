K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification on Iris Dataset
This repository contains a Python project that uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classifying the Iris species. The project performs comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the features of the dataset before applying the KNN model.

About the Project
The goal of this project is to build a classification model that can accurately predict the species of an Iris flower based on its physical characteristics: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. We use the KNN algorithm, a simple and effective supervised machine learning algorithm, to achieve this.

Dataset
The project uses the classic Iris dataset, which is widely used for machine learning classification tasks. The dataset includes 150 samples of Iris flowers from three species: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica. Each sample has four features:

SepalLengthCm

SepalWidthCm

PetalLengthCm

PetalWidthCm

Species (the target variable)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The project includes a detailed EDA section to gain insights into the data. Key observations from the analysis include:

Sepal Length: Iris setosa has significantly smaller sepal lengths than the other two species. Distinguishing between Iris virginica and Iris versicolor is challenging based on this feature alone.

Sepal Width: Iris setosa has a larger sepal width, while Iris versicolor has a smaller one. This feature may not be the most useful for classification due to the close values across species.

Petal Length & Width: These features appear to be excellent predictors. Iris setosa has much smaller petal lengths and widths compared to Iris virginica and Iris versicolor, making it easily distinguishable.

Correlation: There's a positive correlation between sepal length and petal length.

Libraries Used
The project utilizes the following Python libraries:

numpy for numerical operations

pandas for data manipulation and analysis

matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn for static data visualization

plotly.express for interactive data visualizations

How to Run:

1.Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your_username/ML_Algos.git
cd ML_Algos

2.Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly

3.Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script:
The code is located in the KNN.ipynb file. You can run it using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

jupyter notebook

This will open the notebook in your web browser, where you can execute the cells to see the data analysis and model implementation.
